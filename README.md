üìñ About The Project
The Sohojia Foundation Monitoring System is a web-based volunteer and activity monitoring system built for the Sohojia Foundation ‚Äî a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering students in village communities (primarily in remote areas of West Bengal, India) through education, arts (painting, recitation), martial arts (karate), and science (weekly workshops and fairs).

Managing volunteers across multiple centers and rural locations is costly and time-consuming. This project replaces manual oversight with modern automation: location-aware schedules, biometric verification, role-based access control, automated reporting, and media management ‚Äî all tailored to the Foundation's workflows.

üéØ Vision: Bring scientific thinking, quality education, and a creative perspective to under-served rural communities, using structured programs to uplift local living conditions.

ü§ù Mission: Provide reliable monitoring and tools so the Foundation can scale quality education and extracurricular activities while keeping operational overheads low.

Key active chapters and programs include:

Amader Pathshala (Sirjan Chapter) ‚Äî Barshi village, Bankura. Offers structured education and runs the Bigyanusandhan Kendra (Science Center) for hands-on training.

Sokaler Pathshala (Bandwan Chapter) ‚Äî Launched in 2023; morning study sessions now serving 60+ students with 7 volunteers.

Creative Arts & Annual Events ‚Äî Painting exhibitions, recitations and a yearly event that showcased 200+ student paintings.

‚ú® Key Features
1. üîê Hierarchical Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Role Structure: Admin ‚Üí Center Programme Director ‚Üí Center Programme Coordinator ‚Üí {Volunteer, Event Manager} ‚Üí Student.

Secure Authentication: Email/password login, sessions handled with HttpOnly JWT cookies.

Granular Permissions: Middleware (middleware/authJwt.js) enforces what each role can read or modify.

2. üë• Advanced Volunteer & Staff Management
Unified Profile System: Role promotions copy core volunteer data so profiles remain consistent. Edits via volunteer dashboard sync automatically.

Dynamic Onboarding: Admins may pre-register staff and volunteers; users complete registration with details later.

Account Lifecycle: Admins can activate/deactivate accounts. Deactivation removes or archives related data as configured.

3. ‚úÖ Multi-Factor Attendance Verification
üìç Location-Based Check-in: Device GPS must be within a configurable radius (default 100 meters) of scheduled coordinates.

üòä Face Verification: Python microservice using InsightFace (buffalo_l) generates and compares facial embeddings.

üëÜ Fingerprint Verification: WebAuthn (passwordless) support for secure biometric check-ins.

üìÇ Media Storage: Images and embeddings stored to Google Cloud Storage buckets.

4. üóìÔ∏è Comprehensive Schedule & Holiday Management
Dynamic Scheduling: Create day/shift/subject-specific schedules with GPS coordinates.

Seasonal Schedules: Cron jobs switch between summer/winter schedules automatically based on date.

Holidays: Foundation-specific holiday rules respected by absence and attendance logic.

5. üéâ Event & Activity Reporting
Dynamic Event Types: Track events like Karate classes, Painting sessions, Science fairs with custom fields.

Media Uploads: Event photos upload directly to GCS.

Filterable Reports: Exportable and filterable reports for attendance, volunteer activity, and event summaries.

6. ü§ñ Automated Cron Jobs
Absence Checking: Automatically marks absent volunteers on missed sessions.

Lateness Tracking: Marks check-ins as late when they are beyond a configurable threshold (default 15 minutes).

Season Switcher: Applies seasonal start/end times to schedules.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The project uses a hybrid architecture combining a monolithic Node.js application with a Python microservice for AI tasks.

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment & Nginx Configuration
The production environment runs as a Docker container on a Linode server, proxied by Nginx.

Below is a sample Nginx configuration. Replace your_domain.com and adjust paths for your SSL certificates.

Nginx

# /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain.com

# HTTP Server Block - Redirects all traffic to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;
    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;

    client_max_body_size 10M;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/your_domain.access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/your_domain.error.log;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # Node.js app
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

### üìú Obtaining an SSL Certificate (Let's Encrypt / Certbot)

On Ubuntu with snap:

```sh
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Test and reload nginx after certbot completes:

```sh
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

-----

## üîí Security & Privacy

  * **Authentication:** JWT tokens stored in secure, HttpOnly cookies.
  * **Password Storage:** Passwords hashed with `bcrypt`.
  * **Biometric Data:** Facial images and embeddings are treated as sensitive ‚Äî keep storage buckets private, use proper IAM service accounts, and rotate service keys.
  * **Data Retention:** Configure retention and archival policies for media and logs according to Foundation policy and local regulations.

-----

## üíª Development Notes

  * **AI Service:** The Python service exposes endpoints like `/generate-embedding` and `/verify-face` and uses InsightFace with ONNX Runtime for performance.
  * **Database Design:** MySQL stores relational entities (users, roles, schedules). MongoDB stores logs, embeddings metadata, and large non-relational objects.
  * **File Uploads:** Multer middleware handles uploads and streams final files to Google Cloud Storage.
  * **Cron Jobs:** `node-cron` tasks handle absence checking, lateness updates, and seasonal schedule switching.

### workflow

1.  Start DB services (or use cloud dev instances).
2.  Start Node backend with `nodemon` or `npm run dev`.
3.  Start Python AI service in a separate terminal.
4.  Use a browser to access the UI and create test users and schedules.

-----

## üîß Troubleshooting & FAQs

**‚ùì Q: Face verification failing for many users?**

  * Ensure the Python service is running and can access the GCS bucket.
  * Confirm embeddings were created with enough images (10 recommended).
  * Check Python service logs for image-read or ONNX errors.

**‚ùì Q: Cron jobs not running?**

  * Confirm `node-cron` is active and the process is running. In production, ensure only one instance runs scheduled jobs.

**‚ùì Q: File upload size errors in production?**

  * Increase `client_max_body_size` in your Nginx configuration.
